# CRM

This is a demo Customer Relations Managment (CRM) system built with:

- a client-side web app using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- - Vue.js - application framework
- - Bootstrap - user-interface components
- - Showdown - Markdown parser
- a serverless API built with IBM Cloud Functions
- a Cloudant NoSQL database

Read about how this application works [in this blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/03/29/Building-a-CRM-System.html)

## Pre-requisites

- An [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/) account with the [ibmcloud command-line tool](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli) installed and authenticated.
- A Cloudant account provisioned in the IBM Cloud account - make a note of your Cloudant URL.
- Node.js.
- Python.

## Setting up the API

Create an environment variable to store your Cloudant URL:

```sh
export COUCH_URL="<my cloudant url>"
```

Create a Cloudant database with

```sh
curl -X PUT "$URL/crm?partitioned=true"
```

Clone this repository then do:

```sh
cd crm/api
./deploy.sh
```

This will create a number of API calls in your Cloudant account. Make a note of the URLs generated by this process.

## Running the web app.

Modify the `APIURL` variable in `assets/js/crm.js` to match the URL produced when creating your API calls.

Run:

```sh
./start.sh
```

Your CRM should be running on http://localhost:8000
